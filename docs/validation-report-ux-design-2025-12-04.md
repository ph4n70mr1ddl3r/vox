## Failed Items

**Count:** 0

No requirements failed validation.

---

## Partial Items

**Count:** 0

No requirements only partially met.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Items: None
All critical requirements satisfied. Document is production-ready.

### Should Improve (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add Visual Examples** - Consider including low-fidelity sketches of key flows (trust request, reputation display, collaboration accept) to supplement text descriptions
   - *Priority:* Low (specification is already complete)
   - *Effort:* Medium (requires creating 3-4 illustrations)
   - *Impact:* Improves clarity for visual designers

2. **Quantify "Effortless"** - While interaction patterns are clear, consider adding specific metrics for "effortless" (e.g., "trust request in <3 clicks," "reputation visible in <1 second")
   - *Priority:* Low (patterns imply metrics)
   - *Effort:* Low (update existing text)
   - *Impact:* Enables performance measurement during development

3. **Link to Specific Development Frameworks** - Add section on implementation technology recommendations (React, Vue, etc.) to complement Tailwind choice
   - *Priority:* Low (Tailwind choice is sufficient)
   - *Effort:* Low (new subsection)
   - *Impact:* Accelerates development kickoff

### Consider (Nice-to-Haves)

1. **Create Persona Posters** - Visual summary of Sarah, Alex, Jamie with goals, pain points, success criteria for team display
   - *Impact:* Maintains persona focus throughout implementation

2. **Develop Design Tokens Documentation** - Separate living document with all design tokens (colors, spacing, typography values) for developer reference
   - *Impact:* Accelerates development setup

3. **Record Design Walkthrough Video** - 15-20 minute walkthrough of key design decisions for team onboarding
   - *Impact:* Reduces onboarding time and design misunderstandings
